Last time started talking about \textbf{Discretization of Angle} for TE. We looked at the 1-D, slab version of the TE within each group.\\
We mentioned that we need a collection of $\mu_n, w_n$, known as the angular quadrature set. \\
We frequently select $N$ is even and $\mu_n$ are symmetric about $\mu=0$.
%
\begin{align*}
\mu_{N+1-n} &= -\mu_n\:, \quad n = 1, 2, \dots, \frac{N}{2} \quad \mu_n > 0\\
w_n &= w_{N+1-n}
\end{align*}
%
If $N$ weren't even we would get $\mu_{(N+1)/2} = 0$, which makes the derivative term disappear. It can also make our BCs ambiguous.\\
With these conditions we get advantages in the boundary conditions as well.
%
\begin{align*}
\text{reflecting at } x=0 \quad &\psi_n(0) = \psi_{N+1-n}(0)\:, \quad n = 1, 2, \dots, \frac{N}{2}\\
\text{vacuum on right at } x=a \quad &\psi_n(a) = 0\:, \quad n = \frac{N}{2}+1, \frac{N}{2}+2, \dots, N
\end{align*}
%
We have a fair bit of freedom selecting an ordinate set. 
This DO formulation
\begin{itemize}
\item gives us $N$ ODEs and $N$ BCs
\item treats the BCs exactly as long as the direction is in the quadrature set
\item the scattering term is an approximation. You have to interpolate if you need $\psi$ along a non-included angle.
\end{itemize}

In slab, Legendre $P_N$ and Double Legendre $DP_N$ are the most popular (the most well known in 3D is the level symmetric, which is frequently referred to as $S_N$ just to be confusing). \\
We started the idea of $P_N$ in our derivation of the diffusion equation (which is the $P_1$ expansion of the TE). \\ 
The basic idea is that we can expand the angular flux in the same manner we expanded the scattering kernels before. \\
Note, however, that this is a different and distinct process. Now, we will use
\[
\psi(x, \mu) \approx \sum_{l=0}^N (2l+1)\phi_l(x)P_l(\mu)
\]
for the flux solution in total. This next part comes from Appendix D of L\&M. We again start with the within group, 1D TE
\[
\mu \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \Sigma_t(x)\psi(x,\mu) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \Sigma_{s,l}(x) P_l(\mu)\phi_l(x) + S(x,\mu)
\]
where $S(x,\mu)$ is the group source given by
\[
S(x,\mu) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) P_l(\mu) \sum_{g' \neq g} \Sigma_{sl,gg'}(x) \phi_{lg'}(x) + \tilde{S}_g(x,\mu)
\]
with $\tilde{S}_g(x,\mu)$ being the external and/or fission source for the group. 
(I think I forgot to explicitly mention this last time; was also true for the within group in $S_N$).\\
As long as the series is infinite, we are not introducing any approximations.

We can use the Legendre expansion to make our TE an infinite set of coupled ODEs. We use the flux expansion in the equation, multiply by $\frac{1}{2}P_{l'}(\mu)$ and integrate over $-1 \leq \mu 1$:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} &(2l+1)\biggl[ \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu\: \mu P_{l'}(\mu) P_l(\mu) \frac{d}{d x}\phi_l(x) + \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu\: P_{l'}(\mu) P_l(\mu) \Sigma_t(x)\phi_l(x) \biggr] \\
&= \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)\frac{\Sigma_{sl}}{2}\int_{-1}^1 d\mu\: P_{l'}(\mu) P_l(\mu) \phi_l(x) + s_{l'}(x)
\end{align*}
where
\[
s_{l'}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu\:P_{l'}(\mu) s(x,\mu)\:.
\]
We use the orthogonality relation
\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 d\mu\: P_{l'}(\mu) P_l(\mu) = \frac{\delta_{l l'}}{2l+1}
\]
to remove the summation in the collision and scattering terms. \\
However, the streaming term requires more work. We will use the Legendre recursive relationship
\[
\mu P_l(\mu) = \bigl(\frac{l+1}{2l+1}\bigr)P_{l+1}(\mu) + \bigl(\frac{l}{2l+1}\bigr)P_{l-1}(\mu)
\]
to get rid of $\mu$. This all gives, for $l' = 0, 1, \dots$
\[
\bigl(\frac{l'+1}{2l'+1}\bigr)P_{l'+1}(\mu)\frac{d}{d x}\phi_{l'+1}(x) + \bigl(\frac{l'}{2l'+1}\bigr)P_{l'-1}(\mu)\frac{d}{d x}\phi_{l'-1}(x) + \Sigma_t(x) \phi_{l'} = \Sigma_{sl'}(x)\phi_{l'}(x) + s_{l'}(x)\:.
\]
what do we do when $l'=0$ for $\phi_{-1}$? We typically just set it to $0$, which doesn't matter anyway since we don't technically use that moment, giving
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\phi_1(x) + (\underbrace{\Sigma_t - \Sigma_{s0}}_{\Sigma_a})\phi_0(x) = s_0(x)
\]
This is one equation with two unknowns. Let's try $l=1$:
\[
\frac{2}{3}\frac{d}{dx}\phi_2(x) + \frac{1}{3}\frac{d}{dx}\phi_0(x) + (\Sigma_t - \Sigma_{s1})\phi_1(x) = s_1(x)
\]
Every time we add another equation we get another unknown, so we now have a closure problem.\\
To deal with this, we make the $P_N$ \textit{approximation}. We set either 
\[\phi_{N+1} = 0 \quad\text{ or }\quad\frac{d}{dx}\phi_{N+1}=0
\]
(which gives the same effect) to get $N+1$ coupled equations. 

We can see that diffusion theory is the $P_1$ approximation.\\
If we have an isotropic source, $s_1=0$. Use this in the $l=1$ equation to see
\[
\phi_1(x) = \frac{-1}{3(\Sigma_t - \Sigma_{s1})}\frac{d \phi_0}{dx}
\]
where $phi_1$ is also known as the net current - so we've got Fick's Law.\\
The $l=0$ equation is then
\[
\frac{-1}{3(\Sigma_t - \Sigma_{s1})}\frac{d^2 \phi_0}{dx^2} + \Sigma_a \phi_0(x) = s_0(x)\:.
\]


%For an expanded investigation of this and $DP_N$ see Appendix D of L\&M. \\
%Another method of interest is Simplified $P_N$, $SP_N$. We won't cover this, but I'll post a resource about it on our website for anyone who is curious.


 
%Sorting out discrete ordinates for curvilinear geometries requires some extra work. We are going to skip it to make sure we can through spatial discretization and the basics of transport solvers.
